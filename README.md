# Carbon Black Cloud Syslog Connector

## Breaking Changes with v1.3.1

* Leef format logs have been rewritten to better utilize common variables and include as much information as possible
* `cb_defense_syslog.py` has been renamed to `cbc_syslog.py`
* Example config file and cacert have moved from the `cb-defense-syslog` folder to a `cbc-syslog` folder
* Example cron job file has been renamed to cbc-syslog and uses the new file and folder locations

## Introduction

The syslog connector lets administrators forward alert notifications and audit logs from their Carbon Black Cloud instance to local, on-premise systems, and:

* Generates pipe-delimited syslog messages with alert metadata identified by the streaming prevention system
* Aggregates data from one or more Carbon Black Cloud organizations into a single syslog stream
* Can be configured to use UDP, TCP, or encrypted (TCP over TLS) syslog protocols

## Installation

You can install the Syslog Connector using either PyPI or GitHub.

### PyPI Installation

1. Run the following command in your terminal: `pip install cbc-syslog`

2. Copy and paste the Configuration File example from the directory `cbc_syslog_conf_examples` into your 
   own `.conf` file and modify it to your own specifications. Below is a table of all the configurable 
   inputs that can be used in the syslog connector.
   
   ---
   **NOTE**: 
   The `cbc_syslog_conf_examples` will be located ether
   under your pythonn virtual environment or in the system location (usually `/usr/local/`)if you installed 
   into global python.

    | template      | Y       | Template for syslog output.      |
    | back_up_dir      | Y       | Location of the Backup Directory. This will be the location of backup files in the event that results fail to send to Syslog. The backup files are deleted upon a successful process.      |
    | policy_action_severity      | Y       | This sets the default severity level for POLICY_ACTION notifications. By default it is 4.      |
    | output_format      | Y       | Output format of the data sent. Currently support json, leef, and cef formats      |
    | output_type      | Y       | Configures the specific output. Valid options are: 'udp', 'tcp', 'tcp+tls', 'http'      |
    | tcpout      | Y       | Output Type: IP:port      |
    | udp_out      | Y       | Output Type: IP:port      |
    | http_out      | Y       | Output Type: http/https endpoint - ie https://server.company.com/endpoint      |
    | http_headers      | Y       | Required if using http: {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}     |
    | https_ssl_verify      | Y       | Required if using http: True or False      |
    | requests_ca_cert      | N       | Override ca file for self signed certificates when using https      |
    | ca_cert      | N       | Specifies a file containing PEM-encoded CA certificates for verifying the peer server when using TLS+TCP syslog      |
    | cert      | N       | Specifies a file containing PEM-encoded client certificate for verifying this client when using TLS+TCP syslog      |
    | key      | N       | Specifies a file containing PEM-encoded private key for verifying this client when using TLS+TCP syslog      |
    | key_password      | N       | Specifies the password to decrypt the given private key when using TLS+TCP syslog      |
    | tls_verify      | N       |  True or False      |
    | api_connector_id      | Y       | API Connector ID      |
    | api_key      | Y       | API Key      |
    | siem_connector_id      | Y       | SIEM Connector ID      |
    | siem_api_key      | Y       |  SIEM Key      |
    | server_url      | Y       | Server URL      |

4. Create a `.txt` file for Logs.
5. Create an empty backup folder. The location of this folder will be placed in back_up_dir seen in the
Configuration file.  For more information on the behavior of the backup folder please see the description of back_up_dir
in Step 3.
6. Test the new connector and run the following command:

    ```
    cbc-syslog-cli -l [LOG_FILE_LOCATION] -c [CONFIG_FILE_LOCATION]
    ```

    A successful run will look like:

    ```
    INFO:__main__:Carbon Black Cloud Syslog 2.0
    INFO:__main__:Number of files in store forward: 0
    INFO:__main__:Found 2 Carbon Black Cloud Servers in config file

    ```


**Note: If you're having trouble installing on Centos 7 follow these instructions**

* Verify python verison:
```
>$ python --version
Python 2.7.5
```

* Pip not found
```
>$ sudo yum install epel-release
>$ sudo yum -y install python-pip
```

* Python.h file not found with compile errors
```
>$ sudo yum install python-devel
>$ sudo pip install cbc-syslog
```

### GitHub Installation

1. Pull down the Repo. You may use `git clone` or pull down the zip file directly from GitHub.

2. Navigate to the following location within the package `/src/cbc_syslog`

3. Follow Steps 3-6 in the PyPI installation instructions.

### Using Docker
This assumes that docker is installed in your environments.  See https://www.docker.com/ for more information

1. Build the docker container:
```
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile .
```
The last line will be "Successfully built <container Id>".  Take note of the container id to connect to it.

2. Run the container interactively:  
```
docker container run -it <containerId> /bin/bash
```
3. Within the container, configure syslog as per Steps 3-6 in the PyPI installation instructions.
